                Paul Kagame's history began with his family fleeing ethnic violence in Rwanda to Uganda as refugees in 1959, where he grew 
                up, joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel forces, and became a senior intelligence officer.
                 In 1990, he returned to Rwanda to lead the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in the Rwandan Civil War, ultimately defeating
                  the Hutu extremist government and ending the 1994 genocide.
                  He became de facto leader as Vice President/Defense Minister (1994-2000) before becoming President in 2000, focusing on
                  \ rebuilding Rwanda through development, technology, and reconciliation.
